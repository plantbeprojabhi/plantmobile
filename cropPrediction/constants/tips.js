        "plant": "Tomato",
        "tips": "Water a tomato plant deeply with 1 to 2 inches of water each watering session to help it develop a deep, extensive root system. Plant a tomato transplant in the garden once it reaches 6 to 8 inches tall. Pinch off all its lower leaves to increase its root system, which will increase bloom production. Keep weeds under control. Avoid fertilizing a tomato plant until after it sets flowers and fruit. Before then, the nitrogen in fertilizers increases green growth and limits or delays flower production. With all the extra green growth, the tomato plant will be more susceptible to insects."

        "plant": "Strawberry",
        "tips": "Plant your strawberries early for a bumper harvest.  Plant in a sunny area. Give them some space.  Don\u2019t drown the strawberries. Put them in bed.  Pick the flowers. Fertilise. Remove the runners. Plant a variety."

    {
        "plant": "Potato",
        "tips": "Planting as early as possible to extend the length of the growing season in areas where daylight hours are limited. Planting physiologically aged potatoes that emerge quickly. Planting at optimum soil temperatures to ensure fast crop emergence. Use of irrigation, crop nutrition and crop protection methods to ensure maximum canopy life and unlimited tuber growth. Desiccation at the right stage to meet market requirement. Selecting the right variety. Spacing seed to ensure an optimum number of stems per square meter. Using crop protection inputs - such as herbicides and nematicides - to ensure the crop grows relatively unhindered."

        "plant": "Pepper,",
        "tips": "Warm temperature and soil. High humidity. Soil should be well-drained. Slightly Alkaline pH. Prevent Pests. Pinch early flowers. Fertilize only when first planting and after harvesting."

        "plant": "Peach",
        "tips": "Aim to plant your tree in spring. Prepare a section of ground that is 5 feet (1.5 m) or more in diameter. Add peat moss and organic matter such as compost to the prepared soil. Plant your peach tree in the middle of the prepared soil. Apply a mild pesticide to your peach tree after about a week to prevent insects and disease from damaging it. Add a nitrogen fertilizer about twice a year to your peach tree. \nPrune your tree."

    {
        "plant": "Grape",
        "tips": "Test the pH of the soil surrounding the grapevines. Remove grass and weeds from around the base of the grapevines manually to prevent competition with the vines' roots while the vines become established. Check the grapevines for signs of pests such as ants, beetles, rodents, mealybugs and leafhoppers. Inspect the vines weekly for signs of mildew, blight, scale and other illnesses. Fertilize the grapevines using a 10-10-10 fertilizer approximately 30 days before the growing season begins each spring. Remove the majority of grape buds that appear if heavy fruiting occurs during the first two years of growth. Prune grapevines each year in late fall or early spring while the vines are still dormant to encourage increased growth during the following growing season."

        "plant": "Corn",
        "tips": "Plant Early, Plant Effectively. Practice Seasonal Soil Rotation. Know The Yield Potential. Always Scout Your Fields. Ensure Proper Water Drainage. Utilize Fertilizers. Test Your Soil. Weed Early and Often."

    {
        "plant": "Cherry",
        "tips": "Prune out small and pendant wood.  Keep the leaf-to-fruit ratio in balance. Prune for light.  Provide nutrients to achieve two feet of new growth annually. Irrigate when the crop needs it."

    {
        "plant": "Apple",
        "tips": "Plants should be pruned every year to get the best crop, generally in summer for espalier, bushes, fans and pyramids and summer and winter for trees. Feed trees in early spring with a balanced general fertiliser (such as Growmore) at 100g per square metre.  Try to avoid too much fertiliser, water regularly during dry spells, mulch and clear away competing plants and weeds."
