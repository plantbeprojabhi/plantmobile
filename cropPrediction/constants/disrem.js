        "remedy": "There are no chemical controls for viruses. Remove and destroy infected plants promptly. Wash hands thoroughly after smoking (the\u00a0Tobacco mosaic virus\u00a0may be present in certain types of tobacco) and before working in the garden. Eliminate weeds in and near the garden. Control insects (thrips and whiteflies) that carry viruses. Rotate tomatoes with crucifers (such as cabbage, broccoli and turnips). Use reflective mulches. Use virus resistant tomato cultivars. Many cultivars have Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) resistance (the letter T follows the cultivar name), such as: Bush Celebrity, Bush Early Girl, Jetsetter, Big Beef, Celebrity, Sweet Cluster, Sweet Million (cherry), and Super Marzano (paste)."

        "name": "Tomato__Tomato_Yellow_Laef_Curl_Virus",
        "remedy": "\u00a0Removal of plants with initial symptoms may slow the spread of the disease. Rogued (pulled out) infected plants should be immediately bagged to prevent the spread of the whiteflies feeding on those plants. Keep weeds controlled within and around the garden site, as these may be alternate hosts for whiteflies. Reflective mulches (aluminum or silver-colored) can be used in the rows to reduce whitefly feeding. Low concentration sprays of a horticultural oil or canola oil will act as a whitefly repellent, reduce feeding and possibly transmission of the virus. Use a 0.25 to 0.5% oil spray (2 to 4 teaspoons horticultural or canola oil & a few drops of dish soap per gallon of water) weekly. Examples of products containing horticultural oil are Ferti-lome Horticultural Oil Spray and Bonide All Seasons Spray Oil. Example of a product containing canola oil is Espoma Earth-tone Horticultural Oil Ready to Spray."

Remove affected debris to prevent carryover into the next crop. Use an adequate period of crop rotation. Genetic resistance to this fungus has been documented in tomato and soybean but commercial varieties are not yet available."

Since it spreads to potatoes, it also overwinters in potato debris and seed, even in colder areas. Remove all debris and don't save seed potatoes."

        "remedy": "Early blight fungus overwinters in plant residue and is soil-borne. It can also come in on transplants. Remove affected plants and thoroughly clean fall garden debris. Wet weather and stressed plants increase the\u00a0likelihood of attack. Copper and/or sulfur sprays can prevent further development of the fungus. The biofungicide Serenade\u00ae helps to minimize problems with early blight."

Avoid overhead watering by using drip or furrow irrigation. Remove all diseased plant material. Prune plants to promote air circulation. Spraying with a copper fungicide will give fairly good control the bacterial disease."

The infected plant material in the field should be properly destroyed. Grow resistant varieties like Kufri Navtal. Fungicidal sprays can be effective, if given properly and timely. Sprays should  start a few days before the anticipated time of occurrence of the disease or on the appearance of initial symptoms. Cool humid atmosphere favours the disease and prevalence of such weather can be indication of disease in a short time ahead. Spraying should be done with Dithane M-45 or Dithane Z-78 (2.5 kg per 1000 litres of water per hectare). Spraying should be repeated at 10-12 days interval."

        "remedy": "Fungicidal sprays, preferably with copper fungicides or Zineb given at 15 \u00a0\u00a0day intervals effectively control the disease. Since the same spray schedule controls late blight also, it has become a regular practice among potato growers in many tracts to spray the crop with copper fungicides at least three or four times, starting from about six weeks after planting."
